# Aurem
An updated version of AuremEQ from WangCrystal.

The project has been updated to be able to be opened, using Gradle, with Android Studio. You may need to download the Google Maven repository. This should be a semi-automatic process of the IDE, you just need to refactor and re-sync with Gradle. The app remained compatible with all Android terminals from version 2.3.3 Gingerbread up (API Level 10). In modern versions of Android, as far as I can understand, the management of audio effects has been changed, so this app may not guarantee the equalization of some audio streams.
